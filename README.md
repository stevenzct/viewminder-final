Background of the Study
In recent years, the increasing prevalence of videos across various industries has emphasized the necessity of maintaining clear and visible recordings. However, challenges arise when videos are captured in low-light conditions, resulting in quality degradation and hindering practical analysis or information extraction. This demand for improved video quality has led to the development of a Python-based Video-Enhancing Application that addresses common issues encountered in video footage, such as low quality, which can impede the identification of individuals or objects.
